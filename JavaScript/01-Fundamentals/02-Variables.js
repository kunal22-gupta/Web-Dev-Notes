// To store some value we can use var keyword

var a = 1; //here the value "1" is stored in a container with the name "a" which has a data type of number

var b = "Kunal";//here the value "Kunal" is stored in a container with the name "b" which has a data type of string

var c; //the data type of c is undefined here

// You only declare the var keyword once.
// you can't do var a = 2; as a is already declared above.
// but we can modify the value like-
a = 4;
a = b;

// Naming rules for a variable
// 1. The variable name can have alphabets, numbers, underscore and dollar sign. eg:
var name = "Kunal";
var name2 = "Ayush";
var last_name = "Gupta";
var $rich = true;
// 2. However, the name of the variable should not start with a number.
// 3. Always give meaningful variable names. Dont give anything like var lksdjflad = 32341;
